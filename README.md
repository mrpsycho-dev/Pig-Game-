## About the Project

**Pig Game** is a digital rendition of the classic dice game that combines strategy and luck. Players take turns rolling a dice to accumulate points, but beware! Rolling a 1 forfeits the turn and resets all unbanked points. The first player to reach 100 points wins.

This project is inspired by Jonas Schmedtmann's implementation and demonstrates dynamic DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive design principles.
